# **ProxyPal**

ProxyPal is a modern, user-friendly desktop client for managing Shadowsocks connections on **macOS**. Inspired by the
clean interface of Outline, it provides a simple and elegant way to manage and switch between multiple proxy servers.

The application is built with **Python** and **PyQt6** and is designed to integrate seamlessly into the macOS
environment with features like a menu bar icon and automatic theme switching.

## ü§î Why ProxyPal?

This project was born out of a real-world need. Like many others, I was having issues getting the official Outline
client to work consistently on my Mac. After a fresh installation, it simply wouldn't open. I soon discovered that
several of my friends were facing the exact same problem on their machines.

I decided to create a solution. Since my background is in Python, not Swift or other native macOS languages, I built a
new Shadowsocks client from the ground up using the tools I knew best: Python and the powerful PyQt6 framework.

What started as a personal fix has grown into a fully-featured application. ProxyPal is the result of that effort‚Äîa
reliable, modern, and easy-to-use client for anyone who needs a stable way to manage their proxy connections on a Mac. I
hope it helps you as much as it has helped me and my friends!

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get ProxyPal up and running.

**1. Clone the Repository**
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/M-Hammad-Faisal/proxypal.git
cd proxypal
```

**2. Run the Setup Script**
The `setup.sh` script will check for dependencies and install everything you need. You only need to run this once.

```Bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

**3. Make the Manager Script Executable**
The `proxy_manager.sh` script requires execute permissions to run. You only need to do this once.

```Bash
chmod +x proxy_manager.sh
```

**3. Run the Application**
The **only** command you need to run the application is:

```Bash
./proxy_manager.sh start
```

This script will:

- Prompt for your **sudo** password to gain permission to change system network settings.
- Launch the ProxyPal GUI application.
- Automatically handle enabling and disabling the system proxy when you connect or disconnect.

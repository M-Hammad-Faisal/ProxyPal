# **ProxyPal**

ProxyPal is a modern, user-friendly desktop client for managing Shadowsocks connections on **macOS**. Inspired by the
clean interface of Outline, it provides a simple and elegant way to manage and switch between multiple proxy servers.

The application is built with **Python** and **PyQt6** and is designed to integrate seamlessly into the macOS
environment with features like a menu bar icon and automatic theme switching.

## ü§î Why ProxyPal?

This project was born out of a real-world need. Like many others, I was having issues getting the official Outline
client to work consistently on my Mac. After a fresh installation, it simply wouldn't open. I soon discovered that
several of my friends were facing the exact same problem on their machines.

I decided to create a solution. Since my background is in Python, not Swift or other native macOS languages, I built a
new Shadowsocks client from the ground up using the tools I knew best: Python and the powerful PyQt6 framework.

What started as a personal fix has grown into a fully-featured application. ProxyPal is the result of that effort‚Äîa
reliable, modern, and easy-to-use client for anyone who needs a stable way to manage their proxy connections on a Mac. I
hope it helps you as much as it has helped me and my friends!

  access key is copied to the clipboard.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your macOS system:

- **Python 3**: The application is written in Python 3.
- **PyQt6**: The GUI framework used for the application.

```Bash
pip install PyQt6
```

**psutil**: A library for process management.

```Bash

pip install psutil
```

**shadowsocks-libev**: The underlying command-line tool that handles the proxy connection. The easiest way to install it

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get ProxyPal up and running.

**1. Clone the Repository**
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/proxypal.git
cd proxypal
```

**2. Make the Manager Script Executable**
The `proxy_manager.sh` script requires execute permissions to run. You only need to do this once.

```Bash
chmod +x proxy_manager.sh
```

**3. Run the Application**
The **only** command you need to run the application is:

```Bash
./proxy_manager.sh start
```

This script will:

- Prompt for your **sudo** password to gain permission to change system network settings.
- Launch the ProxyPal GUI application.
- Automatically handle enabling and disabling the system proxy when you connect or disconnect.
